					Working with an industry partner has made this project different from all others. We got to interact and work closely with the stakeholders involved, and were able to get their feedback and improve on our solution. We also learned how to deal with the complexity of real-world issues, as there were intricacies that had restricted what we could do or not do. However, our Halliburton mentors were very patient and they took time off from their busy schedule to listen to our ideas, offer advice and work with us to ensure a successful and impactful project.

					The Systems Design Project has provided me with invaluable experiences and insights into the operational functions of the industry. It has broadened my knowledge and skillsets in various aspects, enabling me to gain more confidence in expressing my viewpoints. This experience has inevitably aroused my interest in the relevant oil & gas industry. Additionally, it is critical to think beyond the student's perspective and to constantly incorporate relevant industry practices and perspectives to add value to the project.

					The design project has enabled us to put what we have learnt in the past years into solving real-world problems. For instance, Facility Layout Planning and Engineering Economy are concepts that have been introduced in textbooks, and we had the opportunity to apply them in an industry setting. In addition, the project has provided the opportunity to go beyond the curriculum, and the team managed to pick up software skills, such as web application design to effectuate our solutions. All in all, it has been a fruitful journey.
